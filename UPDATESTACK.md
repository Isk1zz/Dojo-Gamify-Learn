# UPDATESTACK.md — staged asks, not yet done

Working queue, separate from BACKLOG.md (which is the full historical
record). Items here get **erased on completion**, not marked `[x]` and
left — BACKLOG.md is where finished work gets written up. This file is
just "what's still owed."

## Ready to build, no blockers
Nothing right now — Tokens (earn, spend, Token Shop, course-price gating,
see BACKLOG.md) is done. Real-money purchases stay a labeled demo stub
until there's a payment account to wire a Payment Link to — that's a
you-side task, not a code blocker, see `shop/tokens.js`'s `buyPack()`.

## New asks, not yet scoped (flagged, needs a decision first)
- XP-farming / bot-prevention on Final Quiz retries — no anti-abuse check
  exists yet on repeated attempts.
- Lock the Final Quiz until all topics AND all units are passed. Note:
  this reverses the "no hard locks" call the Final Quiz was just built
  under — confirm before building.

## Blocked on the backend (Supabase — assigned, nothing built)
- Career weekly XP ladder.
- Wallet "bank": deposits + 3 stocks (tied to the black market's live
  economy per your call — also blocked on that design).
- Black market (financial pyramid, bots).

## Blocked — no server to send it to
- Post-completion questionnaire (real data collection, no backend yet).

## Design conversation, not yet decided
- Lobby topology: proposed Trunk line / Binary orbit / Ladder rungs.
  Recommended Trunk line. Waiting on your pick before scoping.

## Long-term roadmap (later — needs the account/backend question settled first)
- Finish out the web app, then port to iOS and Android.
- Real account system + online database — currently offline/local-only
  (see landing page copy) on purpose, because nobody on the team knows
  databases yet. A friend who does is expected to be free "later" — this
  whole line (accounts, online DB, and everything above that's "Blocked
  on the backend") waits on that, rather than being half-designed now by
  someone who'd be guessing at the DB side.
